# LinkedIn Clone DApp :chart_with_upwards_trend:

# Overview #

This project is a decentralized LinkedIn-like platform built as a dApp (Decentralized Application) on a blockchain. 
It allows users to create profiles, add skills, projects, and work experience, apply for jobs, and even upload certificates.
This platform aims to provide a decentralized solution for professional networking and job searching, where users have more control over their personal data and professional records.
